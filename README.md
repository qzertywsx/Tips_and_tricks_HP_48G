Tips and tricks for the HP 48G calculator
## Solve quadratic equation (or n-th order polynomial equation)
### Find roots of a polynomial equation

* Go to `SOLVE`->`Solve poly`
* In `COEFFICIENTS` write all the coefficients of the equation
* When all the coefficients is written, press `ENTER` to return to the solver menu
* With the arrow down key go `ROOTS`
* Press `SOLVE`

Example:<br>
Equation: 2x^2-136x+1920=0<br>
Coefficients: 2 -136 1920<br>
Roots: 20 48
